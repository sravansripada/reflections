When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
whenever i am collaborating with people on projects i would want to use a remote repository. Also, 
this helps me in sharing code with others who can use my code for their projects or provide suggestions
to make the code better
this can be used as a way of showcasing some of the cool projects that i am working on

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
there may be some changes that you may have made to suit the code more for sharing with wider audience, it may not make sense to incorporate all 
those changes in local version
come of the files may be deleted from remote as you may deem them unappropriate for public, you may not want to see those chages in local

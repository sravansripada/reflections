When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
whenever i am collaborating with people on projects i would want to use a remote repository. Also, 
this helps me in sharing code with others who can use my code for their projects or provide suggestions
to make the code better
this can be used as a way of showcasing some of the cool projects that i am working on

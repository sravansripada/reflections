What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when git repository is initialized, it enables us to track all the changes that are being made to the contents in the folder/repository.
this is important to track all the changes to files within a folder locally.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is different from the working directory in the sense that it contains files which are ready to tracked by committing them as opposed to a directory which simply lists down the files present
a repo may have multiple files which may not be logically related to one another, hence it may not be beneficial to add all the unrelated files into one commit as it becomes difficult to track changes later. staging area allows the user to add only those files that are required to be comitted in one go so that commits can be based on logical groupings of the files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
staging area can be used to add the specific files that we want to commit, so it is not required to commit all the files at a time. we choose to decide what should be a part of each commit hence can logically bucket the commits. files can be added to staging area by using git add command and they can be pushed using git commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
if i need to make some changes to the code which are kind of experimental in nature, i may not want to do it in the same master node as this does not form the main part of my code as yet. hence it is lot convenient to create branches. i can later merge the changes if i feel this is something which needs to be incorporated to the main code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
having diagrams in place will help us understand the parents of each commit and at which commit was actually initiated. it also makes visualizing merge easier

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
if two branches are merged then the common lines of code between the two programs will be retained, deletion in one of the branches will be ignored and additions in respective branches will be added to the final commit after merge. in the form of a diagram it is easy to visualize where exactly the commits have branched out. parents of each commit can be easily understood and we can rationalize as to why some of the commits are not appearing when git log is executed. its also easy to note which commits can never be reached from depending on where the head is
